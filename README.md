# Data_Collection_Web_Scrapping
Program to demonstrate web scrape for data collection. 
>![NOTE] This program is created to be used only for academic assignments!!!

## Objective
1. Go to Youtube.com
2. Use selenium to type in a search term, - "Kishore kumar" or "ISB".
3. Scrape the top 10 links that show up in the search results. Collect data on link url, link title, subscription channel, no. of
views and time when video was first uploaded or posted.
4. Now for each of the top 10 video links, scrape the top 50 comments (Note: you may need selenium to do the 'sort by' top
comments).
5. For each comment, collect data on who wrote it (user handle), when it was posted, how many replies, upvotes and
downvotes it received.
6. Build a data frame containing the results as output("output_scraping.csv")
